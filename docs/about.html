    <p>
        <strong>vexstreams.com</strong> is a website for finding and watching streams of VEX Robotics and other 
        <a href="https://www.roboticseducation.org">RECF</a> tournaments. Info about events and streams is pulled from RobotEvents.
    </p>
    
    <h3>How do I get my event to show up on this site?</h3>
    <p>
        No special action is required – just include information about the stream in the "Webcast" tab on RobotEvents. The "Stream" link shown in the 
        event listing will be the first link included in the "Webcast" tab.
    </p>

    <h3>Why doesn't this event's stream work on the multiview page?</h3>    
    
    <p>
        Currently, the multiview page only supports events streamed on YouTube or Twitch. Other platforms may be supported in the future, but no promises.
    </p>

    <p>
        Additionally, if a YouTube stream is set to <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/6301625?hl=en">disallow embeds</a>, it cannot be 
        viewed from the multiview page.
